The Data is taken from Kaggle and the link is: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset
Hi there! I'm a movie enthusiast and data scientist with a passion for building intelligent systems that make recommendations based on user preferences. My latest project is a movie recommender model built using machine learning techniques.

Using a dataset of over 45,000+ movies and their ratings, my model analyzes user behavior and movie characteristics to generate personalized recommendations for each user. It considers factors such as genre, cast, director, and release year to provide accurate and relevant suggestions.

The model is built using Python and utilizes several popular libraries including Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-Learn to improve the accuracy of recommendations.

In this repository, you can find the code for the model, as well as instructions on how to use it to generate personalized movie recommendations. I've also included the link for the dataset for testing purposes.

I'm excited to share my work with the community and welcome any feedback or contributions to help improve the model. Let's bring the joy of discovering new movies to more people!
